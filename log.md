# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Hi, My name is Ben but I like to call myself OptimizePrime (https://twitter.com/ed_kinging). Welcome to my #100daysofcode journey. This log contains entries of my journey to become a self-taught Full-stack web developer. 

First off.. big shout out to Haley (https://github.com/haley-dvlpr) from whom I forked this repo, and who also has a well detailed Log I recommend people to use as a starting point. 

### I am here back at the start... I made my first attempt to complete the 100 days of Code challenge on April 24, 2019. I did a couple of days but I never completed the challenge. I guess I can only say life came in the way. However... In 2020, I made a website by bootstrapying my way using Youtube. I am actually proud of how it turned out. You can view it at https://www.cablespark.co.ke/


Now ... Here I am about to begin the 100 days of Code challenge hoping that this time around I can complete it as well as the Free Code Camp program. It's summer, no better time to take on this challenge since I have a bit of time on my hands.

I started the challenge unofficially last week working on the Responsive Web Design on Free Code Camp. I am about to start working on the projects and count today as day one. 


And that is basically my story. So starting today, this log will contain my daily coding log. Let's Get it!! 



### Day 1: June 28, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute page)

**Today's Progress**: I decided I will do a tribute page for Ayrton Senna, one of Formula One's greatest drivers. I started out by writing the HTML that would pass the FCC tests. Once I pass all tests I will get to the CSS part. I wrote most if not all the CSS, but I did not run it through the checks. Anyway tomorrow I will run the tests and complete the CSS, I dont want to take too much time on it.  

**Thoughts:** I reused some code from previous projects but at least I understand what all the code does so I think that's not bad. But I need to get to a point I can write code from scratch without referring to previous work. I will challenge myself as the days go by.

### Day 2: July 3, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute page)

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete the design for the hero section of the page. However, I was copying the layout from a previous project. 

**Thoughts:** I cant wait to get to where I can write code from scratch. Like if I want to move content in a certain way, I know how to do it. Right now, i am doing it all wrong. Copying content from previous project, then tweaking css line by line until it looks the way I want. Hopefully I will get there one day.

### Day 3: July 5, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute page)

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Ayrton Senna's page. I changed the layout and the color scheme. I have styled the about section and by tomorrow I will be done. 

**Thoughts:** I learned the way to check what is not working as expected is to change the color of that element to red to see where it is and why it is not morving. Also starting to get used to using Emmet. I should learn it seperately when I have some time.

### Day 4: July 6, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey form)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Tribute page for Ayrton Senna and started on the Survey page.I was able to style the tribute page how I wanted using flex box and having an awesome Hero image. But I have one problem to fix, I was not able to have the same height for the tweeter embeds. I asked the question on SO I hope someone will help. If not I will debug it after I am done with the other projects.

**Thoughts** Today is the first time I have coded for close to 4 hours. I think that's a good step towards making coding a full time job. Peace Out

### Day 5: July 7, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey form)

**Today's Progress**: I Finished the survey page, which is not so bad, I like the background image.
I also started working on the Product landing page. I will create a product landing page for an F1 Merch shop. Peace Out

**Link to work**:https://codepen.io/Benmuiruri/full/NWjxJOj

**Thoughts** I am glad I am almost to a full week of green commits on Github. I am enjoying the streak, I also like how once you get going you just learn things along the way. For instance, today I came across this site that has some neat css tricks for styling buttons. I cant wait to continue tomorrow. Peace Out

### Day 6: July 8, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page)

**Today's Progress:** I finished working on the about section, and started working on the merch section. I was thinking of having something fancy but after spending about 20 minutes looking throigh Jekyll templates I realized my skills are still limited so its better to go with something simple. Later when I have learned jekyll a bit more, I can come and update the Merch section. Also for some weird reason when I was trying to style to product wrapper in css the body section cuts off and becomes just the about section. It's like the wrapper exists outside the body, yet in the html it is very much inside the body. I will deal with that tomorrow. For today, At least I have all the photos and the html. Tomorrow it's just about styling the 4 cards.  Peace Out

### Day 7: July 12, 2021
##### (freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page)

**Today's Progress:** I am going slower than I would want but I am still learning a few things, like how to play around with margin and padding. Today I was not in the mood to code, but nonetheless, I spent like 3 hours making some progress on the Product land page. I should finish up the web page tomorrow. Peace Out

### Day 8: July 13, 2021
##### [(freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page))]

**Today's Progress:** I finally finished the product landing page and I think it looks dope if I should say so myself. I was also happy that I was able to tweak some aspects different from the tutorial I was following. I then started working on the Technical Development page. I chose to write a page dedicated to Solidity because my hope is to one day become a Blockchain developer. Also because of the progress I have been making I was able to view the page at https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/ and I knew what code I had to write. I am starting to learn how to apply technical sophistication to think of coding solutions. Peace Out

### Day 9: July 14, 2021
#####  [(freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page)]

**Today's Progress:** I completed the technical documentation page with somewhat of an intro into solidity; the programming language behind the Ethereum Blockchain. The code really looks complex.... But I will get there. 

I am happy with my progress so far. My brain is learning to think, I know things like "Ah, some padding should fix this" or "this is not working because its parent is position fixed." Tomorrow I start workign on the Personal Portfolio Webpage, which should be fun. Until then, Peace Out.

### Day 10: July 15, 2021
##### [(freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage)]

**Today's Progress:** I started working on the Personal Portfolio Webpage, which is coming along great. I found some inspiration from Jekyll and so far so good. I should be through with the Personal Portfolio Webpage by tomorrow and then on Saturday I can start the Javascript section, pretty interesting. Practicing everyday is helping me learn how to think like a dev and I am loving it. Until tomorrow, Peace Out.


### Day 11: July 17, 2021
##### [(freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage)]

**Today's Progress:** Today I did some work styling the header section, I also added a button that I quite like :). I finished up on the header section then styled the social media section. I added the html for the projects sections all that is left is styling it with a bit of CSS. I will have to log like 1 hour tomorrow even though it is a Sunday so that by Monday I I am ready to start Javascript.

### Day 12: July 19, 2021
#####  freeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress:** I was able to finish up on the Personal portfolio webpage. I really like how it turned out. One thing I plan to do is to change the nav on it once I have learned JS. Because I want the sticky nav not to appear until the user scrolls down, I believe that will be possible using JS. 

After finishing that project, I was able to start the JS tutorial on FCC. It was basic JS which I know most of. I cant wait to get into the juicy interesting JS later on.

### Day 13: July 21, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript 

**Today's Progress:** Did about 2 hours of learning about the Basic Javascript. It was mostly things I already know. I cannot wait to get the JS projects when things will ger interesting and I can get to gets my hands "dirty." Anyway for now, we learn the basics of JS.


### Day 14: July 22, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress:** Today was another day of learning basic JS. I learned topics starting from JS objects. At least with objects we are starting to learn about aspects of JS that require application of logic. For instance, how would you take in input and store it as objects in an array. So that was kind of fun. After learning abotu objects I stumpled upon an interesting exercise about quering a record collection. If a certain check is true do something like add a parameter to an object in the array else delete a parameter from the object. 

So this fun exercise combined if.. else logic with reading and writing from objects. In my first attempt I failed because I rushed through the logic of it, and the code was not executing as it should. So although I am calling it a night and creating today's log. I am going to spend an hour, try to rewrite that code challenge from scratch and see if it I can manage. Fingers crossed... Peace Out

### Day 15: July 24, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about iteration. For looks are always interesting. I bumped across the wonder that is recursion... I understand the logic behind it but I have a feeling if I ever need to implement it in real life, I would have a challange with it. But atleast I understand the logic behind it... the function calls itself n times, and ever time n reduces by 1. 

I also did the Profile look up exercise which can be found in the link below. I got half of the exercise right but one part of it did not work. THe right answer used a nested if within a for look, while I only used one if .. else. Anyway, I need to revisit that solution and take a second look at my implementation to understand why mine did not work. 

When I look at the solution, I can see the logic but I need to understand why mine is wrong. i think that is equally important.

### Day 16: July 26, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript 

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Basic JS section, it was kind of interesting. Some of the things I need to learn more about with some handson exercise is nested loops, nested if...else, and recursive functions. 

But for now, I am done with Basic JS, I will start ES6 JS tomorrow. 

**Side Note** Yesterday I came across a Freecode camp tutorial on solidity. That is where my focus is ... i want to get there. Day 16 of 100... not bad. That's basically more than 15% of the challenge complete. Until tomorrow, Peace out.

### Day 17: July 27, 2021 + Day 18: July 28, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - ES6 Javascript 

**Two days Progress**: 

I started the ES6 JS section on the 27th but 30 minutes after starting I got a call that made me get off my computer. However, today on the 28th I was able to continue with the ES6 section from start to finish, it took me about 2 hours. 

I really enjoyed ES6 syntax it makes code look elegant.

**Highlights:** 

- I was syked to learn about setter and getter methods. Learning about constructors just got me excited about working with API's because API's make programming infinite. You can basically access any data you want *Well, data you have been allowed to access*
- I was impressed that I graspped the concepts of contructor functions quite well. 
- Learning about Promises was also exciting because I can already see the potential of using them in real world web apps. ES6 was very exciting. 

- Tomorrow I start on regex. I have some exposure to regex on Ruby and it is never fun. But its part of the process. Until then, Peace out. 


### Day 19: July 29, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Javascript Regex

**Today's Progress**: 
As expected I did not enjoy the exercises on Regular Expressions. Working on Regex is a sure way to get a headache. 

On the one hand, I enjoyed learning about REGEX it felt like I was understanding it better. However, when it comes to applying regex, it is never easy. I had to look at the solution, because I was stuck on matching one string.



**Highlights**: Are there highlights for learning or working with regex.... I dout it. Anyway tomorrow I will finish up on the regex section. Until then, peace out.

### Day 20: August 2, 2021 + Day 21: August 3, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Javascript Regex
**Two days Progress**:  
On August 2  I finally finished Regex. In the end I kind of understood how to use it but it can be quite tricky. I dont know if I will ever use Regex, but I would like to think I know enough to use my technical sophistication to work with REGEx.

On August 4 I did the very short debugging section on Free Code Camp. Tommorrow I will start the Basic Data Structure section. Until then, Peace out. 



### Day 22: August 4, 2021 
##### freeCodeCamp -  Basic Data Structures
**Today's Progress**:  
I started the Basic Data Structures section which deals with using Arrays and Objects. This includes how to add data, access data, delete data and all that. 

But on this day, I did not get to code much, after just 30 minutes I got a very distracting call. I only got to learn about array methods for adding data, accessing data, and deleting data using the various methods.  

### Day 23: August 5, 2021 
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Data Structures 
**Today's Progress**:  
Thursday was a more productive day, I was able to complete the  Basic Data Structures course which ends with some interesting lessons. 

**Highlights**: I enjoyed learning how to iterate through all items in an array using loops. Best of all was learning how to iterate the elements of an array within an array. I also enjoyed learning how to iterate through keys of an object using the For...in method. 

However, I feel I need practice with these two aspects to grasp them even further. 

### Day 24: August 8, 2021 
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting
**Today's Progress**:  
I completed the asic Data Structures course and started on the Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges. Some of the challenges are straightforward some are a bit tricky. 

I find myself solving half of the problem, then getting stuck with solving the rest of the challenge. But with some Googling I am usually able to solve the complete challenge. 

**Highlights**: Even though sometimes I get stuck with completing the challenge. I am glad that at least I am able to correctly think "This is how I should solve this problem." Unfortunately, sometimes I get stuck with easy stuff. But It is part of the journey


### Day 25: August 9, 2021 
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting 
**Today's Progress**:  
Continued on with the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. Some are easy some are not but at least I am moving along. 

**Highlights**: In the month of July I logged 33 hours of coding. That might be much, but the key is consistency. I will try to add a few more hours in August and keep the momentum going. Peace Out.


### Day 26: August 11, 2021 
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting 
**Today's Progress**:  
Continued on with the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. Similar to Day 25, some were easy and some were not but at least I am moving along. 

I logged an hour of coding before my brain freezed since it was late at night. Tomorrow I must finish this section. I feel I am slacking.

### Day 27: August 12, 2021 
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting 
**Today's Progress**:  
Continued on with the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. However, on this day I was stuck at the use Splice() and Slice() methods to copy an array into another array. After about an hour I could not get it to output what I wanted. I was so close yet so far. Eventually I had to check how to do the challenge. 

**Highlights**: After getting stuck for as long as I was and having to check how to get the challenge done, I spent sometime reading the Mozilla MDN page for the spice() method. Took a while but I finally understood how it works. From that exercise I learned it is important to read documentation. Take a step back from what you think you know, read the documentation and rewrite the code one line at a time. 

PS - I really need to finsih the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges!! I need to make time for more coding.

### Day 28: August 13, 2021 + Day 29: August 16, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting 
**Two days Progress**:  
On Friday, I logged about an hour of coding still working on the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges but I was not able to finish them all. But on Monday I was able to get in about an hour and 30 minutes to finish that section. I also started on Object Oriented Programming. Still in the introdution sections can't wait for things to get intresting. 

**Thoughts**: Usually I write about the highlights of each section but as I came towards the end of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges, I was finding it harder to come up with solutions on my own. I dont know if I am being unfair on myself but I felt abit of imposter syndrom. I was wondering why I could not think through the solution on my own. 

So what would happen is I would think, "I need to check if the characters of this array and in this other array" but I cannot write out that code. So I would google "How to check whether one array has the characters of another array." I wish I could write out the code without having to Google.


### Day 30: August 17, 2021 + Day 31: August 18, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Object Oriented Programming 
**Two days Progress**:  
Spent the two days learning Object Oriented Programming. I learned the basics of creating a Basic JS object, accessing Object properties using the Dot Notation, creating a method on an object, using the this keyword, using a constructor, using Prototype properties and Own properties. 

I also learned a bit more interesting stuff of using Mixins and using an IIFE, but that was just the introduction of these interesting stuff. Cant want to use the in practice. THe OOP section was not too big, I was able to finish it in the two days.

**Link to work**[Object Oriented Programming Exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#object-oriented-programming)


### Day 32: August 23, 2021
##### freeCodeCamp - Functional Programming
**One day Progress**:  
After finishing OOP, the next stop was Functional programming. The first day was learning why we use functional programming: to avoid changing global variables, code should be packaged in functions that take input, do something and give output. 

**Thoughts**: Funtional programming is an interesting concept, which I also cant wait to tinker around with. 

**Link to work**[Functional Programming Exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#functional-programming)

### Day 33: August 24, 2021 + Day 37: August 31, 2021
##### Functional Programming and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
**Five days Progress**:  
One August 24 and 25 I continued with functional progeamming. I learned how to use map, filter, and reduce. I would likt to think that I have completely mastered how to use map and filter. I saved a generic code snippet that can help me use those two. 

However, I need more practice with reduce. I finished the Functinal programming over those two days. 

On August 26 I started the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section. My goodness it is not easy. 

Just like the Basic Algorithm Scripting I can think about half the solution but I cant think about the entire solution. Often I got stuck and had to use the hint. So far I have done 6 challenges. I have done 3 on my own, but the other 3 I looked at the solution after getting stuck at the half way point of the solution. 

However, I do take an hour of Technical sophisticated Googling before looking at the solution. Hopefully with more practice I can improve my problem solving.

### Day 38: September 6, 2021
##### Functional Programming and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
**One day Progress**:  
I have not been myself lately, not been feeling upto the task of coding. I have been in a lull. But after 5 days I finally got back to the exercises. I logged one hour today and did some interesting challenges, that were not hard, just tricky. THey all needed me to take a minute and think how to do it.  

Hopefully, I have the energy to continue tomorrow. Till then, Peace Out

### Day 39: September 7, 2021 + Day 40: September 8, 2021
##### Functional Programming and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
**Two day Progress**:  
September 7th I was feeling more like myself I was able to get in some decent hours of coding. I continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Exercises. 

Finally on September 8th I finished Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Exercises. 


**Thoughts**: I have come a long way since I started the JS section. I am glad I can now think "This problem can be solved like this." However, I find myself getting stuck sometimes half way to the solution. But this things take time and a lot of practice. It's just been 40 days so I should not expect that I can solve each problem I face. I just need to keep practicing and writing code. July I logged 33 hours of codeing, August I logged 21 hours. That's not great... I should be adding more hours not reducing. 

Here is to a more code-ful september, Peace out.

### Day 41: September 9, 2021 + Day 42: September 21, 2021 + Day 43: September 23, 2021
##### Functional Programming and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
**Three day Progress**:

I think I jinxed myself by saying that I would have a code-ful September, because I was only able to code 3 days in the whole of September. 

Sigh. 


### Day 44: October 7, 2021 + Day 45: October 12, 2021
##### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects
**Two day Progress**:

October was also not a great month, sigh. 
I was only able to code for two days to complete the Javascript projects. 


### Day 46: November 4, 2021 - Day 53: November 12, 2021
##### Front End Development Libraries
**Eight day Progress**:

Finally after wasting two months, something finally changed in November that changed how I am approaching this 100-day-challenge. I realized that I am not just doing this challenge to look cool or to try and keep myself busy. I am actually doing this challenge because I want to change my future. I want to secure my future and my family's future by teaching myself how to code and become a software engineer. 

I came across a quote that completely changed how I will approach this challenge and ultimately achieve my deams

**"There is no PASSION to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you KNOW you are CAPABLE of living!"**

On November 4th I started the Front End Development Libraries section which includes Bootstrap, SASS, JQuery, React and Redux. 

I completed Bootstrap, JQuery and SASS the easy stuff and got into React and Redux.

**Thoughts**: React and Redux are beautiful frameworks. I love the whole idea of state, reducers, and action creators. It makes thinking about an App quite logical. I can see how to think about creaing a project. I cant wait to get started on a project once I finish learning React. 

**Link to work**[Front End Development Libraries React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)


### Day 54: November 14, 2021
##### Front End Development Libraries
**One day Progress**:

Sunday Funday!! 

I'm sure we have all been there when you have that itch to finish something. That was me on Sunday, I just wanted to finish the React and Redux section. I did the section without any major challenges. 

I am impressed how well I have grasped React. Maybe it is my destiny to work in React. Anyway I will find out how well I have grasped React in the upcoming challenges 

**Thoughts** I will say it again, I really enjoyed learning react, I like its composability using Components and states.

### Day 55: November 18, 2021
##### Front End Development Libraries Projects
**One day Progress**:

Getting to work on the React challenges. I am getting the hang of it. I am really enjoying it 

**Thoughts** Can't wait to finish the projects and put my React skills to work.
